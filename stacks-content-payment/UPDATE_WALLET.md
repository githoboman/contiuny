# Wallet Update Required

## ⚠️ Action Needed: Update Testnet.toml

The deployment is still using the **old wallet address** (ST34SWDZ8QJEB124ZBEVN6A69DDVQXNVH66AJKY65).

This means your new mnemonic hasn't been saved to `settings/Testnet.toml` yet.

## 📝 Steps to Update

1. **Open the file:**
   ```
   settings/Testnet.toml
   ```

2. **Find the mnemonic line** (around line 7-8)

3. **Replace with your new mnemonic:**
   ```toml
   mnemonic = "Bulk broccoli suffer lonely often stereo detect parent number chaos decline sight"
   ```

4. **Save the file**
